## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* private math tuition teachers
* has a need to manage a number of students' contacts and performance
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**:

Tutors tend to use multiple applications to keep track of their schedule/progress work. MATHUTORING comes in to centralise the features into a single application with a contact management system to track the students’ progress report which subsequently allows the tutors to plan their lesson plan for future lessons and overall view of their schedule for ease of planning.

2.  Should be able to hold up to 1000 students' information without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
3.  A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
4.  The application should work on both 32-bit and 64-bit environments.
5.  The application should responses within 3 seconds.
6.  The user interface should be intuitive enough for users who are not IT-savvy.
