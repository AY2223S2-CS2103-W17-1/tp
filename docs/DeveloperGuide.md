## **Setting up, getting started**

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Design**

### Architecture

### UI component

### Logic component

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-W17-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

#### Task model
**API** : [`Task.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-W17-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/task/Task.java)

<img src="images/TaskClassDiagram.png" width="280" />

* A `Person` has a `TaskList` object which holds all their `Task` objects.
* Each `Task` object has a `TaskStatus` assigned to it and can be any of `INPROGRESS`, `LATE` or `COMPLETE`.
* The `creationDate` will be hidden from the user and only be used for sorting the `TaskList`.

### Storage component

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* Private math tuition teachers
* has a need to manage a number of students' contacts and performance
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**:

Tutors tend to use multiple applications to keep track of their schedule/progress work. MATHUTORING comes in to centralise the features into a single application with a contact management system to track the students’ progress report which subsequently allows the tutors to plan their lesson plan for future lessons and overall view of their schedule for ease of planning.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1.  Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `11` or above installed.
2.  Should be able to hold up to 1000 students' information without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
3.  A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
4.  The application should work on both 32-bit and 64-bit environments.
5.  The application should respond within 3 seconds.
6.  The user interface should be intuitive enough for users who are not IT-savvy.
7.  The product is free of charge.

### Glossary

* **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, OS-X
* **Tutors**: Private math tuition teachers that will be using the application
* **Students' progress**: For our current version, the progress of a student is tracked through 
the number of tasks the student has completed 
* **Students' performance**: For our current version, the performance of a student is tracked through a view
of the student's scores. In future implementation, a student's performance will be shown in a line chart
