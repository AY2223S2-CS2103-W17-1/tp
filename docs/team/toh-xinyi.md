MATHUTORING is a desktop application for private math tuition teachers to manage their students' contact as well as
their progress. It allows these tutors to track their studentsâ€™ progress report which subsequently allows them to plan
future lessons and have an overall view of their schedule for ease of planning.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**:
  * [`addtask`](https://ay2223s2-cs2103-w17-1.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#1-adding-a-task-for-a-student-addtask)
